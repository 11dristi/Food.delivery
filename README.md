just sharing two images from my first practice on Figma. Here’s a simple explanation for each:

Login Screen (Image 1):

Design Elements: You’ve used bright colors like yellow and orange to create a vibrant food delivery theme.
Graphics: The delivery person on a bicycle and the pizza graphics convey the purpose (food delivery).
UI: The login form is simple with two fields (email, password) and a “Login” button. There’s a “Forgot password?” link and an option for users who have already signed in.
Hierarchy: The graphic elements and the form are well separated, giving clarity to each section.

Welcome Screen (Image 2):

Design Elements: The same theme of bright colors, with an emphasis on the service’s message, "The best food delivery service." The use of yellow gradients adds depth.
Graphics: Similar delivery rider icon, maintaining consistency in branding.
UI: Two clear buttons for “Sign in” and “Sign up,” with the sign-up button being secondary. The use of arrows makes the actions intuitive.
Both screens are well designed, minimal, and focused on clarity. If you need any adjustments or want to know more about design improvements, feel free to ask!
